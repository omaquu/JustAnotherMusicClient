A desktop YouTube Music client built with Tauri, React, and TypeScript for **Windows, MacOs & Linux**.

<br>

> **IMPORTANT** This is an independent, unofficial project and is not affiliated with, authorized by, sponsored by, or endorsed by YouTube or Google. The only reason I am making this, is becuase there is no official YouTube music desktop client.

## About ℹ️

JustAnotherMusicClient brings YouTube Music to the desktop in a focused, native-feeling application. YouTube does not provide an official desktop client, so this project aims to provide a polished alternative that integrates with YouTube Music while keeping the experience fast and familiar.

## Roadmap 📌
View the 👉 [public roadmap here](https://justanothermusicclient.userjot.com/) 👈

## Platform Support 💻

- **Windows** is the primary supported platform.
- **macOS** supported. Sometimes some experimental releases don't work at first, so try some older ones if that is the case.
- **Linux** supported. Sometimes some experimental releases don't work at first, so try some older ones if that is the case

### Linux Notes
On some Wayland desktops, the AppImage can open a blank grey window with an EGL error. If that happens, try launching it with:

```bash
LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libwayland-client.so ./Just.Another.Music.Client_1.2.71_amd64.AppImage
```

If playback or window controls still fail, open the app log from Settings and include it with the issue report. The exact desktop environment, display server, and distro help a lot for Linux bugs.

### MacOs Issues
**MacOs may prompt you with a Keychain popup asking for permission.** The app stores one encryption key in its own Keychain entry. Your YouTube Music session is encrypted with that key before it is saved in the app data directory.

If you do not need signing into YouTube Music you dont need to grant Keychain permissions. If you do it is recommended to click "always allow" in the popup to prevent MacOs from being annoying 

## Legal
**This project DOES NOT offer any downloading functionality. This is a client providing Theme and Decorative additions for audio listening only.**

**If anyone from Google reads this:** There was no official client, I just wanted a good desktop client. Thats why I made this, please don't sue me!
